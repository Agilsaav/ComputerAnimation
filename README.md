# Computer Animation
 
The Particles Simulation project and the String System Simulation project have been developed using Visual Studio 2019 in Windows.

## Particles Simulation

Small physics engine which simulate the interaction of the particles with planes, triangles and spheres.
The computations can be made using three simulation solvers: 
#### Euler Solver (Key X)
#### Semi-Euler (Key C)
#### Verlet (Key V)
The solver can be changed in real time using the key indicated for each one. 
It also implements three initializations modes which can be chaned also in real time: 
#### Fountain (Key 1)
#### Waterfall (Key 2)
#### Explosion (Key 3)

## String System Simulation

Integration of String System Simulations in one dimension and two dimensions in the Particle Simulation engine.
